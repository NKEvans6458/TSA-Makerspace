      <p style="font-size:20px; width:70%; text-align:center; margin:auto;">A makerspace can be any space in your school where students and teachers come together to create, invent, prototype, design, tinker, explore, discover, code, build, craft, draft, draw, and more. Students can work individually or collaboratively using a variety of high and low-tech tools and materials.</p>
